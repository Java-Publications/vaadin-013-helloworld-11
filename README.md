# Backend meets Frontend: Application development with Vaadin
After the last parts of "Backend meets Frontend" have dealt with the testing of a Vaadin application, we will now turn to the application development itself. In our small sample project we keep an eye on topics such as internationalization and changeability.


## How to start
To play with this you only have to start the main - method from the class  ```org.rapidpm.vaadin.helloworld.server.Main``` and 
go with your browser to the address: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

Ok, you got your first Vaadin "Hello World".
